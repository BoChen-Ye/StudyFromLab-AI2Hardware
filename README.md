# StudyFromLab:AI2Hardware
When studying a course, I find I prefer learning through labs rather than videos or slides. 
Therefore, I created this repository to gather useful labs from various open-source courses.

# Structure
## Deep Learning
This section will introduce the basic knowledge of **deep learning**.

### Basic NN
This lab use python to develop **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)**.

This lab from [AI Computing System](https://novel.ict.ac.cn/aics/) and reference [lab github](https://github.com/Yuichi1001/2024-AICS-EXP).

### VGG network
This lab use python to develop **VGG19 network**.

This lab from [AI Computing System](https://novel.ict.ac.cn/aics/) and reference [lab github](https://github.com/Yuichi1001/2024-AICS-EXP).
The `imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat` can be download from [website](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/beta16/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat). 

### VGG pytorch
This lab use **pytorch** framework to develop VGG19 network.

This lab from [AI Computing System](https://novel.ict.ac.cn/aics/) and reference [lab github](https://github.com/Yuichi1001/2024-AICS-EXP).

### Pruning and Quantization
This lab will practice **pruning and quantizing** a classical neural network model to reduce both model size and latency.

You can upload `.ipynb` to Google Colab to use jupyter notebook and pytorch environment.

This lab from [TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning Computing](https://efficientml.ai) and reference [lab github](https://github.com/yifanlu0227/MIT-6.5940).

### Neural Architecture Reaserch
This lab learn how to search for a tiny neural network that can run efficiently on a microcontroller.
